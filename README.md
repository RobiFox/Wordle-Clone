# Wordle Spring Clone
Just a small Wordle Backend Clone as a side project.

Everyday, you have to guess a 5-letter English Word. You get 5 tries, and with each try, the game tells you which letters are in the correct place, which are in the incorrect place and which letters are not in the word at all.
